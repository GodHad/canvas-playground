# Canvas Effects

All the required setup code is in the `app.tsx` file.

## Task 1

Create a text effect that looks like a carved wood sign:

![](./wood.jpeg)
![](./wood2.jpg)

Notice how the text is engraved into the wood and has light reflection and depth.

## Task 2

Create a text outline effect that follows the shape of the text:


![](./outline1.jpg)
![](./outline2.jpeg)
![](./outline3.jpg)

One possible solution is to by stroking the text, but you will need to find a way to seamlessly connect the edges of the words together.

This must support words on multiple lines.
